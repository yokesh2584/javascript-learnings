# ðŸŒ¸ Daily Learning Log â€“ May 22, 2025

A magnificent bloom of understanding, a day well-lived in the world of code and curiosity. Today walked through some of the most profound chambers of JavaScriptâ€™s palace. Letâ€™s weave a garland of all that blossomed today...

## ðŸ§  What I Practiced

- **JavaScript OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**

  - Built mini-challenges involving class inheritance, encapsulation, and method extensions
  - Practiced overriding methods and accessing parent logic with `super.method()`

- **Recursive Memoization with Pure Functions**

  - Converted recursive Fibonacci and Factorial functions into memoized versions
  - Tested memoization performance using Node.js backend â€” results were blazing fast!

- **Functional Programming Challenges**
  - Solved real-life tasks using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`
  - Explored function composition and began understanding functional purity

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned

### ðŸ”¸ Classes and OOP in JS

- ES6 `class` syntax and how to use `constructor` to initialize objects
- How to create inheritance with `extends`
- The purpose and behavior of `super()` and `super.method()`
- Concepts of Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Polymorphism in practice

### ðŸ”¸ Regular Expressions

- Learned to match, extract, and manipulate strings using powerful patterns

### ðŸ”¸ Date and Time in JS

- Worked with `Date()` constructor, parsed timestamps, and formatted output

### ðŸ”¸ Timers in JavaScript

- Used `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` to schedule actions asynchronously

### ðŸ”µ Master-Level JavaScript

#### Advanced Patterns

- **Module Pattern**: Encapsulating variables and exposing only whatâ€™s needed
- **Revealing Module Pattern**: Structuring modules to expose clean interfaces
- **IIFE**: Executing functions immediately after definition to isolate scope
- **Memoization**: Storing expensive function results to avoid redundant computation

#### Functional Programming Concepts

- **Pure Functions**: Functions with no side effects and consistent return for same input
- **Immutability**: Avoiding direct mutations to original data
- **Currying**: Transforming functions to take arguments one at a time
- **Function Composition**: Combining small functions to build complex transformations

## ðŸ’­ What I Thought

- OOP principles truly come to life when writing mini-projects â€” inheritance and polymorphism felt intuitive through code
- Memoization is a superpower when performance is critical
- Functional composition felt abstract at first, but the challenges made it more tangible
- Solving the filter and reduce problems gave a real sense of data transformation mastery
- Every concept connected like puzzle pieces to build a fuller picture of elegant JavaScript

## âœ¨ Insights

- Functional purity encourages reusable and testable code
- Encapsulation helps prevent unwanted access and keeps the logic safe
- Memoization reduces computation time significantly â€” essential in recursive-heavy algorithms
- Understanding IIFE and module patterns gives confidence in code organization and protection

---

## ðŸ”® Whatâ€™s Next

- Deeper dive into advanced event loop mechanisms and concurrency
- Master async behaviors: microtasks, macrotasks, and execution order
- Continue Functional Programming with `functors`, `monads`, and real-world use cases
- Start working on mini-projects combining functional and object-oriented principles
