# 🌟 JavaScript Mastery Journey — Day 10 Log (May 26, 2025)

## 📌 Topics Covered:

**JavaScript Unit Testing: Core Concepts, Edge Case Handling, and Nested Object Utilities**

---

## 🧪 Unit Testing Fundamentals (with Jest)

### 🔍 Concepts Practiced:

- Understood **what unit testing is**, why it’s important, and how it improves code quality and reliability
- Explored the **`Jest` testing framework** — writing tests using `test()` and `expect()`
- Ran tests using CLI with coverage insights

---

## 🛠️ Utility Function: `getNestedValue`

### 🧠 What I Did:

- Built a utility function to **safely access deeply nested object values**
- Supported both **dot-separated string paths** and **array-based paths**
- Handled invalid inputs like:
  - Empty objects
  - Null, non-object, or array as input
  - Invalid or non-existing paths
- Practiced **error handling and throwing custom errors**

---

## 🧪 Test Cases Written:

- ✅ Checked proper return of nested values
- ✅ Tested for various edge cases like:
  - Empty object input
  - Invalid paths or missing keys
  - Non-object types (number, string, array, null)
- ✅ Covered both string-based and array-based paths

---

## 😌 Personal Reflections:

- Felt amazed realizing how elegant `.reduce()` can be for traversing paths in objects! 🌈
- Initially thought in a one-dimensional way — but today, perspective **expanded like a blooming lotus** 🪷
- Testing taught me to **slow down and anticipate failure** — so I can build code that stands tall even in chaos
- This log is a little flag I’m planting in the land of mastery — proud and peaceful ❤️‍🔥
