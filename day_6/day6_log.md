# ðŸŒ¸ Daily Learning Log â€“ May 21, 2025

The sun has set on another chapter, and in its twilight, I find my skills blooming. Here's what I sowed and nurtured in my developer garden today...

---

## ðŸ§  What I Practiced

- **Mini Projects using Event Delegation**  
  Built:

  - `QuotesApp` â€“ adding, deleting quotes with delegated events
  - `ShoppingListApp` â€“ dynamic item management via event bubbling

- **Browser APIs Practice**

  - Used `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for saving data persistently or temporarily
  - Practiced `fetch()` for API requests, handling JSON responses
  - Explored `Geolocation API` for getting user's location
  - Played with `Clipboard API` to read/copy user clipboard data

- **JavaScript Classes & OOP**
  - Created classes with constructors
  - Extended classes with `extends` and used `super()` correctly
  - Declared and used static methods and fields
  - Encapsulated class data using `#privateFields`

---

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned

- Event delegation is a smart way to handle many dynamic elements efficiently
- `localStorage` persists even after the page reloads, while `sessionStorage` is session-bound
- `fetch()` is promise-based and can be chained for clean async flows
- `Geolocation API` can request coordinates, but needs permissions
- `Clipboard API` can access or manipulate clipboard, but works best on secure contexts (HTTPS)
- `class` is a blueprint, and `constructor` sets up instances with specific values
- `super()` must be called with matching args from the base class
- `static` methods/fields belong to the class itself, not its instances
- `#privateFields` encapsulate logic, keeping internals safe from external tampering

---

## ðŸ’­ What I Thought

- Mini projects make theory feel aliveâ€”nothing teaches like making mistakes and fixing them
- API capabilities show how powerful the browser can be as a toolâ€”not just a viewer
- Understanding `super` and `private fields` made me feel like a real object-oriented warrior
- The day felt like stitching front-end logic and back-end behaviors together into a flowing fabric

---

## âœ¨ Insights

- The separation of instance vs static logic is crucial when organizing class responsibilities
- Local storage is surprisingly handy for building stateful experiences without a backend
- Event delegation makes large, dynamic UIs manageable and performance-friendly
- Learning to work with APIs deepens my ability to interact with the outside world programmatically

---

## ðŸ”® Whatâ€™s Next

- Deep dive into Getters & Setters for encapsulated computed properties
- Exploring Method Overriding & `super.method()` in subclasses
- Practicing Polymorphism and real-world object design patterns
- Begin OOP mini-project: maybe a `Library System` or `Banking Dashboard` using all class features
