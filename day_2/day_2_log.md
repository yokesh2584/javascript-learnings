# Day 2 Log â€” May 17, 2025

## âœ… What I practiced:

- JavaScript functions: declaration, expression, arrow, anonymous.
- Explored function scope and block vs function scope.
- Deep dive into scope types â€” global, local, block.
- Understood and tested hoisting in JS with var, let, and const.

## ðŸ’¡ What I learned:

- var is function-scoped and hoisted with undefined, while let and const are block-scoped and live in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).
- Scope resolution moves from inner to outer (lexical scoping).
- You canâ€™t access block-scoped variables (let, const) outside their {} blocks, but var escapes like a rebel.
- Functions can be declared in multiple ways â€” each with different syntax and slight behavior differences.

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts:

- The clarity Iâ€™m gaining about scope and hoisting feels empowering. These concepts once felt foggy, but now I see the mechanics behind the magic. Iâ€™m building strong foundations â€” one brick at a time.

## ðŸ”œ Whatâ€™s next (Day 3):

Revisit JS if energy permits â€” maybe dive into closures or arrays in-depth.
