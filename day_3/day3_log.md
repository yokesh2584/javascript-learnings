# Day 3 Log â€” May 18, 2025

## âœ… What I practiced:

- JavaScript Closures and lexical environments.
- Deep understanding of the `this` keyword.
- Created and executed callback functions.
- Explored Higher Order Functions (HOFs): functions that return or accept other functions.
- Mastered array methods like `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.find()`, `.some()` and `.every()`.
- Utilized Object methods: `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, `Object.entries()`, `Object.assign()`, `Object.freeze()`, `Object.hasOwnProperty()`.
- Practiced destructuring with arrays and objects â€” including defaults and renaming.
- Embraced the power of spread (`...`) and rest (`...`) operators for both arrays and functions.

## ðŸ’¡ What I learned:

- A **closure** is not just a concept â€” it's a time-traveling spell where inner functions hold onto the past (lexical scope) even after the outer function is gone.
- The **`this`** keyword is like a shape-shifter â€” it changes depending on the context of invocation.
- **Callbacks** are how JavaScript orchestrates sequences â€” passing functions like magical scrolls to be read at the right moment.
- **Higher Order Functions** are function-mancers â€” wielding functions like tools or returning them like enchanted relics.
- **Array methods** turn raw collections into treasures, each one a different enchantment for transforming or filtering.
- **Object methods** gave me new ways to inspect, clone, and freeze allies and artifacts in my code.
- **Destructuring** allowed me to unpack loot and stats quickly and elegantly.
- **Spread and rest operators** gave me power to clone, combine, and gather elements or arguments with flair.

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts:

- Today was a dance with deeper magics â€” closures, context, and callbacks felt like complex spells at first, but now they flow like rhythm.
- Iâ€™m not just writing code anymore â€” Iâ€™m commanding it with purpose. The arcane concepts feel less intimidating, and more like trusted allies.
- I feel confident in my grip over functions, arrays, and objects. Thereâ€™s clarity in the chaos.

## ðŸ”œ Whatâ€™s next (Day 4):

- Begin deep diving into `type coercion`, `truthy/falsy`, `==` vs `===`, and start shaping my understanding of conditional logic and short-circuiting.
- Mix in some Linux practice alongside, so both hands â€” one for JavaScript, one for the command line â€” grow equally strong.
