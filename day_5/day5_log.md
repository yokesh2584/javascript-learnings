Another day has gone into the river of time, and here's what I dipped my hands into, learning and crafting the edges of my developer self...

## ðŸ§  What I Practiced

- **DOM Manipulation**  
  Practiced:
  - Selecting elements using `getElementById`, `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`
  - Changing content with `textContent`, `innerHTML`
  - Changing styles directly and using `classList`
  - Adding and removing attributes

---

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned

- The subtle differences between `innerHTML`, `textContent`, and `innerText`
- The power of `classList.add/remove/toggle` to switch between states
- How DOM Tree works like a nested object

---

## ðŸ’­ What I Thought

- DOM feels like a danceâ€”one element leads, the others follow in sync
- Changing content dynamically gave me a glimpse of how real-time user experiences are shaped
- The browser is no longer a static page, it's a canvas I can paint on with logic

---

## âœ¨ Insights

- Itâ€™s easier to debug DOM changes when I keep my CSS classes well-structured
- Practice is more powerful than readingâ€”seeing the changes live lights up the memory

---

## ðŸ”® Whatâ€™s Next

- Event Handling (addEventListener, inline vs JS-bound)
- Exploring Event Propagation and Delegation
- Mini project: Form with validation (HTML5 + JS)
