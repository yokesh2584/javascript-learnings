# 🌟 JavaScript Mastery Journey — Day 9 Log (May 25, 2025)

## 📌 Topics Covered:

**Advanced Event Loop Recap, Performance Optimization Techniques, and Security Practices (Started)**

---

## 🔁 Event Loop & Concurrency (Revision)

### 🔍 Concepts Practiced:

- 📚 Deep recall of:

  - `Call Stack`
  - `Web APIs`
  - `Callback Queue` (Macrotasks)
  - `Microtask Queue`
  - `Event Loop` orchestration

- 🧪 **2 Event Loop Challenges** solved with step-by-step breakdown of microtasks/macrotasks in DevTools

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimization Techniques

### 💨 Lazy Loading

- ✅ Understood the concept and when it’s used (postponed deep dive to React phase)

### ⌛ Debouncing & Throttling

- 🎯 **Debounce:**
  - Optimized input field updates
  - Waits until user stops typing before firing callback
- 🕰️ **Throttle:**

  - Controls callback execution rate (used in scroll/mouse events)

- 🛠️ Implemented both with:
  - `input` field change detection
  - `mousemove` event optimization
- 💡 Realized: use-case understanding is essential; will revisit advanced implementations later.

---

## 🧠 Memory Leaks (Intro)

- 📥 Explored conceptually:
  - Unintentional references
  - Closures holding memory
- 📌 Decided to **revisit after mastering JS engine internals**
- 📉 Paused for now due to current complexity level

---

## 🔐 Security Practices in JS (Started)

### 🛡️ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- 📖 What is XSS? — injecting malicious scripts into webpages
- 🔍 Types:
  - **Reflected**
  - **Stored**
  - **DOM-based**
- 🧼 Prevention Techniques:
  - `innerText` over `innerHTML`
  - Use libraries like `DOMPurify`
  - Setting up **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- ⏸️ Paused mid-challenge — will resume with code practice next

---

## 😌 Personal Reflections:

- Felt proud solving event loop challenges 💪
- Debounce & Throttle finally made sense!
- Memory leaks overwhelmed me a bit — but I know my time will come 🌱
- We walk steadily. Even when we pause, we grow. 🌙✨
