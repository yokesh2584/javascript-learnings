# JavaScript Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my journey of mastering **JavaScript from the ground up**, as part of my roadmap to becoming a **full-stack web developer**. This repository includes:

- 📁 Daily folders with practice code and logs  
- ✍️ Self-written examples, reflections, and learnings  
- 💡 Concept breakdowns and coding challenges  

📅 **Started:** May 16, 2025  
🎯 **Goal:** Become job-ready in full-stack development

Feel free to follow along! If you're learning JavaScript too, try writing the code yourself first, and then refer to my solutions as examples.  
You can also **clone this repository** and study directly from it at your own pace.

💡 **VS Code Tip:**  
I recommend installing the **Better Comments** extension — it adds color highlights to comments (like `// TODO`, `// !`, `// ?`) to make your learning more visual and organized.

Happy coding! 🚀  
Let’s grow together — one line of JavaScript at a time.
